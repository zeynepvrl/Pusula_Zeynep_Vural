## Side Effect Data Analysis and Machine Learning Preparation

# Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset related to medication side effects and preparing it for machine learning model training. The dataset includes information on patients' demographics, medications, and their associated side effects. The goal is to explore the data, visualize key insights, and preprocess it for machine learning applications.

# Features
* Load and clean data from an Excel file.
* Calculate and visualize the average age of patients by chronic illness.
* Identify and display the most common medications and their side effects for various chronic conditions.
* Prepare the dataset for machine learning by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

# Instructions to Run the Code
* Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn openpyxl
   
* Download the Dataset: Place the dataset file (side_effect_data 1.xlsx) in the appropriate directory. Update the file path in the code if necessary.

* Run the Script: Execute the Python script in your environment. This can be done in a Jupyter notebook, Google Colab, or any Python IDE.

* Review Output: The script will generate various plots that visualize the common medications and their side effects for different chronic illnesses. It will also prepare the dataset for machine learning by handling missing values and encoding categorical data.
